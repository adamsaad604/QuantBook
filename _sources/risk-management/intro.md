## Risk Management

### Overview

Risk management is a fundamental discipline in finance, guiding decision-making under uncertainty. This section explores quantitative techniques used to measure, forecast, and mitigate various forms of financial risk â€” including market, credit, and liquidity risk.

Projects and analyses in this section are grounded in core principles from both academic literature and professional practice. Techniques span from traditional volatility modeling and Value-at-Risk (VaR) to more advanced frameworks involving GARCH models, backtesting methodologies, and hedging strategies.

### What You'll Find

- Exploratory and applied projects on market risk forecasting  
- Backtesting and evaluation of risk models  
- Derivative-based hedging overlays and performance metrics  
- Use of public market data and replicable Python-based workflows  

Each project is designed to demonstrate practical implementation alongside conceptual rigor, with a focus on transparency, interpretability, and real-world relevance.

### Learning Objectives

By engaging with the material in this section, you will:
- Understand how to quantify and interpret risk in financial time series  
- Implement commonly used models for volatility and risk forecasting  
- Evaluate the performance and reliability of risk models  
- Design risk-aware portfolio overlays and stress scenarios
